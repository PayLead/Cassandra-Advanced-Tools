# Cassandra-Advanced-Tools
This tool is designed to bring some extra features that are not in Cassandra or in DSE solutions.

- Audit a KeySpace: listing all keyspace tables. For each one, we have all fields with there types. And Tables parameters.
- Stats: Listing a bench of keyspace stats.

The Audit can be generated as HTML file or as Latex file.
